# UnityPongGame
A small project to bring myself back into the flow and mindset of game development. 
---
Through this project I hope to:
1. Bring myself back into using Unity after a long hiatus.
2. Bring my mind back into the mindset of game development. 
3. Learning and re-learning how to implement aspects into games. 
4. Learn how to utilize Github for my projects.
